# EmuRTools

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of EmuRTools is to support the Emu SDMS (including the
[Emu-Webapp](https://github.com/IPS-LMU/EMU-webApp/) and [Emu
R](https://github.com/IPS-LMU/emuR/)) developed at the IPS Munich. The
package will include R functions and GUI tools for creating, managing
and analysing large phonetic corpora. This package is under active
development and is not yet for production use. Please contact the author
for more information on the timeline of the package or if you have any
suggestions for features (if so, use the
[Issues](https://github.com/Hywel-Stoakes/EmuRTools/issues) tab on
GitHub ). For more information on the Emu SDMS see [the
Manual](https://ips-lmu.github.io/The-EMU-SDMS-Manual/).

This package is built on the \[Golem framework\]
(<https://engineering-shiny.org/golem.html>) for Shiny and it documented
using the [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org) and Rmarkdown packages.
